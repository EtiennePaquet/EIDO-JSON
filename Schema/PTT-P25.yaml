        channelNac:
          type: string
          description: The Network Access Code (NAC) for the talkpath, if available. May be in hex or decimal format. 
        channelEncrypted:
          type: boolean
          description: Indicates whether the talk path is encrypted.
        SystemAlias:
          type: string
          description: The alias or common name for radio system. Typically the name for a radio system. For example, 'Allied Matrix for Emergency Response'.
        WACN:
          type: string
          description: The Wide Area Communications Network  code for the system. This with the SystemID uniquely identifies a trunked radio system.
        SystemId:
          type: string
          description: The system ID for a trunked radio system. This with the WACN uniquely identifies a trunked radio system.
        units:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              alias:
                type: string
                description: The common name or alias for units assigned to the talk path for the incident. For example, 'Cruiser-2020-Mobile' or 'Dern Handy'.
              ID:
                type: string
                description: The unique ID for the radio terminal assigned to the talk path for the incident. Can be presented in hex or decimal.
        talkMode:
          enum:
            - Group
            - Private
          description: Whether the talk path is a group or private call. Typically, talk paths are group calls.
        groupMode:
          type: string
          description:
            The type of group call if the talk path is a group call. Typically, group calls will be in conventional (through a repeater) or trunked mode (over a trunked radio system). MUST be a value from the groupMode registry in the Emergency area in IANA protocol registries.
        radioBearer:
          type: array
          items: 
            type: string
            description: The frequency band(s) for radio bearer(s) that the talk path may be conveyed on. Typically this is determined by the frequency band that a radio repeater or trunked radio system is configured for. MUST be a value from the radioBearer registry in the Emergency area in IANA protocol registries.
